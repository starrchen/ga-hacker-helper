One of our favorite things about class interactions on Slack is the awesome resources that everyone - students and teachers alike - posts. However, even if you star links that you liked on Slack, it can still be difficult to manage them across several different channels and if they are posted without context. (Sometimes the URL doesn't give us all the information!)

Enter GA-Lossary. View all helpful links in one place, organized by topic. Submit and view different links that your classmates may find useful and/or fun.
