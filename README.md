One of our favorite things about class interactions on Slack is the awesome resources that everyone - students and teachers alike - posts. However, even if you star links that you liked on Slack, it can still be difficult to manage them across several different channels and if they are posted without context. (Sometimes the URL doesn't give us all the information!)
